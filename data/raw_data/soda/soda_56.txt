After nearly 25 years on the market, PepsiCo is saying “so long” to its lemon-lime flavored drink, Sierra Mist. Now gearing up for all things new in the new year, the longtime brand has announced the launch of a new lemon-lime soda with a cosmic name to replace the brand formerly known as Mist Twist: STARRY.Set to hit shelves this week, PepsiCo notes that this new soda just “hits different” in comparison to other lemon-lime sodas. “The demand for lemon-lime flavored soda has never been greater, with category growth accelerating since 2019, there’s a significant opportunity now to give people a choice in an area that’s been dominated by one brand for years,” the release for the new product said.In an effort to go head-to-head with their Coca-Cola-owned competitor, Sprite, PepsiCo introduced Sierra Mist in 1999. In recent years, however, the 24-year-old brand has lost traction next to Sprite — but that’s where STARRY comes in as an effort to reinvent Pepsi’s stake in the lemon-lime soda category.So, what can you expect when popping the top on a STARRY beverage? Like its competitor and predecessor, STARRY is caffeine-free, optimally sweet, and easy-to-drink, making it a refreshing take on a classic flavor combination that doesn’t seem to get old. “With Starry, we were able to create a game-changing recipe with the perfect balance of lemon-lime flavor and sweetness compared to the competition,” Danielle Barbaro, vice president R&D at PepsiCo Beverages North America, said.STARRY is set to come in a variety of sizes and while those haven’t been fully confirmed as of yet, 10-packs of 7.5-ounce mini cans have been spotted on shelves at Walmart. Additionally, those looking to try out the new sip can expect to see it in both original and zero-sugar options with cans and bottles featuring a yellow and green design.
